= Adopt-a-JSR workshop: JCache

== Introduction (10 mins)

=== JCache

=== Payara

Payara is a Java application server derived from the Glassfish code base. 

== Prerequisites (20 mins) 

=== Setup your IDE for Java EE development

Download Eclipse, IntelliJ or NetBeans with JavaEE support: 

 - Eclipse for Java EE developers package can be downloaded from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/mars2;
 - IntelliJ community edition can be downloaded from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download (unless you have license for the Ultimate edition that provides better support for Java EE development);
 - NetBeans with Java EE support can be downloaded from https://netbeans.org/downloads/

=== Setup Payara server

 1. Download Payara server full (latest version) from http://www.payara.fish/downloads
 2. Extract the Payara server zip to a proper directory (e.g. D:\Software)
 3. Run the Java DB RDBMS that comes with Payara by executing the D:\Software\payara-4.1.1.161.1\payara41\javadb\bin\startNetworkServer script. 
    Note that Java DB (also known as Apache Derby) is also shipped with Glassfish distributions.
    By default the Java DB server accepts connections on port 1527. 
 4. Start Payara server using the asadmin script as follows: 
 	D:\Software\payara-4.1.1.161.1\payara41\bin\asadmin start-domain
 5. Verify that server is started by logging in the admin interface at http://localhost:4848/ (Payara uses a modified version of the Glassfish admin interface)
	If the admin interface does not load the check the Payara logs at D:\software\payara-4.1.1.161.1\payara41\glassfish\domains\domain1\logs errors during initialization.
